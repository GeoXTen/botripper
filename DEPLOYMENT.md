### 3. Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
# Clone your repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/botripper.git
cd botripper

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your webhook URL
# Then test locally
npm start
```

## üìä Monitoring Your Bot

After deployment, your bot will:
- ‚úÖ Send a test message when it starts
- üîç Check forum every 5 minutes (configurable)
- üì® Send notifications for new posts with source/download links
- üö® Send error alerts if something goes wrong
- üìà Send status updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Bot not starting?
- Check environment variables are set correctly
- Verify Discord webhook URL is valid
- Check logs in your hosting platform

### No notifications?
- Bot might already be tracking posts in database
- Check if posts have source/download links
- Verify forum structure hasn't changed

### Getting rate limited?
- Increase `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` to 10 or 15
- Reduce `MAX_POSTS_PER_CHECK` to 5

## üîÑ Updating Your Bot

1. Make changes to your fork on GitHub
2. Your hosting platform will automatically redeploy
3. Or manually redeploy from your hosting dashboard
